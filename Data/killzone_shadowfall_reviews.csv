Let me get this out of the way first: it looks great. This game is gorgeous\, the graphics are superb. But that doesn't change the game itself. It's a shiny\, well-polished pile of **** There are a lot of cool concepts in the game itself but every single one of them is executed horrendously. The gameplay is absolute trash; it plays like a Nintendo 64 game that has been slightly remastered (poorly) for the new gen consoles. Every chapter has something different in it\, cool right? No. Every chapter introduces you to a new concept\, a new way to play\, and the game never tells you what to do with your new tech. Every level plays like a tutorial and never allows you to get used to any of the mechanics. There are like maybe three different weapons you can pick up off the ground but no matter what\, you ALWAYS have to carry around an assault rifle that the game chooses for you\, and you can't trade it for something else. I hated the damn gun\, it fires fast and reloads slow so I was stuck having to use other guns to shoot\, and you can only have one other gun besides the ****ty one they give you. Such a step down from the third game which allowed you an assault rifle\, heavy weapon\, and sidearm of your choosing. What's the justification of decreasing the player's options? Some amazing elements in K2 and K3 were removed in this game\, including cover and stealth. The weapons do a lot of damage and the enemies take little before they die. It's not hard at all but every gun reloads extremely slowly which hindered my gameplay so much. I'm all for harder games that challenge your playstyle and force you to take a more methodical approach\, but this is not that game. It's not a hard game\, it's just designed so poorly that you're forced to keep replaying checkpoints until you're able to make up for the **** mechanics. The automatic checkpoints are unapologetically bad\, forcing me to restart checkpoints with enemies directly in front of me without any ammo in my weapon. The objective markers are so lazily implemented and sometimes just don't show up at all\, making this game a maze to navigate. For the first three missions\, I dug it pretty well. The fourth mission wasn't too bad\, and then 5-9 were absolutely abysmal. 10 was a joke. When I started playing 10 (which is a post credit scene out of left field)\, I thought \""wow\, finally. let's see what this game can do with stealth\,\"" but it got old fast. And it didn't make sense at all. Major plot hole. Which brings me to...story! What story?! What characters?! The introduction made me tear up\, it was sweet and beautiful. Everything after that? The opposite. This game has the most bland story\, most inconsistent gameplay\, most amateur mechanics\, and most reasons for people getting an Xbox to buy Halo instead. Oh\, the voice acting. Honestly\, so forgettable. It seems like they got the voice for \""Guy in Baseball Hat\"" from some random movie background to play the lead. And I don't even remember the character's name. The only cool character was Ghost or whatever the girl's name was but she's just sprinkled in the game here and there with no arc. Other supporting characters pop in and out of the story but never mean anything at all. I'd be hard pressed to remember anything about this game in just a few days. There are so many times throughout the game in which you just have to press a button here\, press a button there\, and then do this. It doesn't feel like a game at all. Also\, the button mapping is garbage and even when you remap the buttons\, the on-screen instructions still use the classic controls. How could that be overlooked? Why is Circle the same button for \""interact\"" as it is \""crouch\""? So many times throughout the game I would run over to adrenaline packs and try to pick them up but instead I'd just be humping the wall right in front of the pack itself. It's glitchy\, sloppy\, and disasterously disappointing. Abysmal\, indeed.… Expand"

Now some people may know and you will find out know I loved the **** out of Killzone 3 so I was proper excited for this game. Sadly I can say I was rather disappointed with the result of Killzone Shadow Fall.The story is a direct sequel to Killzone 3. Helghan is destroyed and the Helghast are now living on Vekta good ole Berlin wall style. You play Lucas Kellan\, who was being violently kicked out of New Helghan. After seeing your father shot in front of you. Many years later you become a Shadow Marshall\, which is a fancy title for special forces.  The rest of the game is you behind enemy lines investigating or hunting down targets. The game has almost none of the original characters from the series being that this all takes place 20 years after Killzone 3. So no more bromance from Sev and Rico\, know this game lacks the Bro that the shooter series previously had. I also must say a change they make that I do hate is that they took out the cut scenes. They technically still have \""cut scenes\"" but they are all Call of Duty style. Those aren't bad but I did miss seeing the story being told from different points of view and not just my bland character. They also got rid of any good villains. The villains they have are your cookie cut out of what a shooter villain should be. I can't even tell you their names cause they might as well been some masked space Nazi. You character is also very bland. I felt like he was supposed to be on the set  of Call of Duty and just walked onto this one. There are set pieces which I thought were good but nothing quite as amazing as Killzone 3. The ending does take a turn I didn't entirely see coming. It was actually a bit confusing until I sat and thought about it for a minute.The games graphics are good not blow me out of my seat fantastic just good. The environment and guns and character models in cut scenes all look great. The biggest flaw I saw in the graphics was the human faces outside of cut scenes. They weren't atrocious but in comparison to the rest of the game they didn't hold up.The sound was interesting. The voice acting was done well enough to  get the story across. The guns and explosions all sounded fantastic. The real elephant in the room was the sound that would come from the controller. It would only come out when you picked up an audio log but it would sound so damn creepy. They weren't scary sounds just the fact that it is coming out of the controller was something I wasn't used to so it gave a ominous feel.Now like any game you are wondering Brandon does the gameplay. Well little one I shall tell you\, it is the best controls of any of the Killzone games. The previous ones had really sensitive aiming in them which made them a bit hard to control. This one feels as good as any of the shooters today. The touchpad controls this very useful drone that can do a number of things from attacking the enemy to reviving your ass if you get downed. On normal I did feel like the challenge was perfect not too easy nor too hard. It was a perfect balance but the biggest problem I had was how the game was structured. Since you have to be this covert ops guy you don't fight in any big battles it is always you VS a group of Helghast. The problem is the entire series is about a war and what I loved about the previous two games is I felt like I was in war. This one just was copying Call of Duty Ghost with just about everything except it was set in space. You get a variety of weapons and the game changes enough to keep from ever getting repetitive so those are all pluses there.Now this is going to sound strange coming from me but if you own a PS4 get this game for the online. The online supports 24 players being on either the humans or space Nazis side. You start out with a butt load of different premade classes to choose from and you can customize any class to your liking. The game will have a big learning curve but from a guy who is not used to multiplayer I must say I enjoyed the **** out of this\, and I wasn't half bad at it either. You do unlock more weapons and goodies but I don't see a need because the weapons they give you are badass. You get a bunch of different versions of Warzone. You get team death match\, capture points\, hide and seek\, classic\, and many more I can't think of at the time. The absolute best part of multiplayer is how it ends. It ends with what I imagine the best players on the winning team executing  a member of the losing team. I see it a get all funny inside\, sadly I wasn't ever one of the executioners.Overall the single player is a shell of what Killzone 2 and 3 were but the multiplayer is the reason to stay. Honestly it was the multiplayer that saved this game so I give it a 7/10.… Expand"

So why they thought it would be a good idea to mess it up again in Killzone Shadow Fall is beyond me.

There is very little I can say positive about this trainwreck of a game besides that I finished it and never have to play it again. You can definitely tell that the A-list development crew at Guerilla was working on Horizon Zero Dawn at the time\, because the only parts that weren’t clunky\, visually or gameplay-wise\, were the parts shown as a tech demo during the PS4 launch or E3.The story is the biggest joke since the end of Killzone 3 and the destruction of Helgan. There are absolutely no likeable characters (main or side) and the main character’s adoptive father should have been the main antagonist because he was grating to have to deal with in any situation.For gameplay the main mechanic is shooting\, (you know in a FPS\, someone should inform Guerilla Games) which works more like a generic COD shooter than a Killzone game. There is no weight behind your movements or your melee attacks. It just feels slippery. The animations at some points just don’t exist for ‘cut-scenes’ (at one point the doctor who is talking to me screams ‘NO!’ with absolutely no facial or lip movement whatsoever\, not to mention the terrible voice acting that accompanied this scene) which completely pull you out of the game. At one point in the 2nd level of the game\, in the core they actually put in platforming into a FPS\, which is as bad as it sounds. You have to jump across walkways as they collapse to escape the ship in a first person view so you have no way to judge your jumps. Then for some reason the tutorial level also exists in the fourth level of the campaign when the tutorial cues start telling you how to jump\, crouch\, and aim as though you haven’t just done three levels (about 3-4 hours of tedium) worth of it! Great work from Guerilla’s D-team.A lot of the gameplay consists around sneaking around the map with ‘stealth’\, which the AI can see you perfectly\, mainly through walls and behind cover\, making stealth useless. Also\, the level design doesn’t help as there are traps and cameras that’ll make the whole map aware of your location. And you’ll have to one man army it through the whole Helgan army with only your trusty OWL at your side. Now how about that OWL robot\, don’t even get me started. It’s a great idea but\, once again\, gameplay-wise it doesn’t work. Most of the time when he’s supposed to revive you\, he can’t reach you\, despite hovering right on top of you. And when you send him to shoot at enemies\, you’ll find him shooting at a wall. You’ll start to wonder if he’s working with the enemy.A strange thing I don’t know if anyone else noticed\, but if a grenade goes off next to you while you’re aiming\, your camera will go spinning like a top uncontrollably and stare straight at the ceiling\, which is one of the biggest physics glitches I’ve ever seen in a FPS.If you want a game that Killzone: Shallow Fall should have been like\, play Titanfall 2’s campaign\, or if you want a better (and graphically superior) game made by Guerilla’s A-team that was in development at the same time\, play Horizon Zero Dawn. Stay away from Killzone: Shadow Fall\, it’s not worth your time\, even if you can play it for free\, especially if you’re a Killzone fan (insert I’ve played every Killzone here).… Expand"

Right off the bat I understood precisely what they meant.Shadowfall is no corridor shooter like the previous titles\, it tries to innovate the experience by creating a more thoughtful way of approaching combat from the first person perspective. Gone have the days of facing wave after wave of enemies being the meat of the game\, instead you are forced to take a more conservative\, tactical approach. But does it work? Yes and no. Once I got used to the pacing and what Guerrilla were trying to do here I found the game very enjoyable\, less linear and more expansive than previous Killzone games. However\, on harder difficulties this is what kills the gameplay experience and turns it into a frustration filled mess. The lack of a straight line path means that enemies can come from anywhere and without a detailed hud telling you where they or where they may come from through the use of maybe\, an objective marker\, you are left wondering just who killed you this time. This is by far the games biggest flaw\, but on lower difficulties I didn't find this to be a problem\, but if there are any trophy hunters out there\, do yourself a favor\, and play the game on normal difficulty first.Being a shadow marshal and not a grunt on the front line means that combat has become a lot more technical\, you don't face as many enemies and you have abilities to keep things interesting. Your drone gives you advantages such as shields and stun shocks to help out when things get tough and it also helps you traverse the beautiful open terrain. It is accessible through the use of the DS4's touch pad\, which I think worked well and was a nice touch. Weapons feel great\, and when your in those skirmish situations where it's clear where the enemies are\, combat is very fluid. The enemies vary in difficulty as you face different factions within the Helgast military. Most importantly to note however is the lack of a constant character that you have to annoyingly follow around\, leading you from this objective to the next\, instead now you choose how to approach each combat situation which has been pulled off brilliantly\, you can go in loud\, or stealth your way through. But be warned\, doing the latter is challenging due to the AI's credible intelligence. This is the freedom that Shadowfall gives you as Guerrilla try to drag it away from the dull affair we experience with whatever Call of Duty we might be playing.On to the graphics\, they're stunning. Showcasing what can already be achieved with the PS4 and I was blown away with chapter 2 of the game. Even in multiplayer the graphics hold up really well. In another change to the way Guerrilla have gone bout Shadowfall\, it is a lot more colorful a game. Say bye bye to grey Helghan corridors and say hello to lush\, vibrant environments that range from the slums of New Helghan to the beauty shown in the woodland area of chapter 2. Weapons look and sound great\, textures are detailed and varied\, character models are fantastic although lip syncing could be improved. Over all though the presentation here is fantastic.The story for Killzone can be summed up like this: It takes off a few decades after the events of Killzone 3 and you're living side by side with the Helghast in a Berlin Wall-like scenario. You're Lucas Kellan a trained shadow marshal\, after unearthing some secrets of the VSA and Helgast you learn that a war is coming\, and go on a roller-coaster ride to stop it from endangering the lives of innocent people on both sides of the conflict.If Killzone has ever had anything going for it\, it's a dedicated and loyal fan base. To this day you can get into games on KZ2 servers and play a game\, and it's good to see that Guerrilla have created another brilliant online experience. Multiplayer is smooth and I experienced no lag. Players can jump in to official warzones\, user created war zones of different levels of awesomeness or create their own. You're not limited to what you can do with Shadowfall's multiplayer\, and that's awesome and is fully acknowledged by letting you choose from the full range of weapons\, right from the start. A brilliant stat tracking mechanism is also in place\, so you always know exactly how you're doing and how far you're off from the next upgrade for your weapon. In short if you've played Killzones multiplayer before\, you'll fit right in here\, and if you're sick of Call of Duty's copy and paste online experience\, Shadowfall may surprise you\, it's definitely worth a punt and overall I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game amidst some of the negative reviews it's been given. The story may be not much more than a technical demo for what the PS4 is capable of\, but it definitely showcases the types of jaw dropping experiences we could see going forward. It is a worthy launch title\, a blast to play.… Expand"

Guerilla accepted the honor of having Killzone Shadow Fall be a launch title for the PS4 to showcase the power of its graphics. It is a very visually stunning game\, probably one of the most beautiful I've played to date. You may even forget that you're playing a shooter with the gorgeous backgrounds. However\, being a launch title also meant the game was rushed and lacked content at launch. Initially\, warzones had very limited options which impacted the game with negative reviews and a low playerbase. While there have been numerous improvements\, the damage had already been done. I just picked up a copy of the game cheap and the numbers in multiplayer are still low. I feel like Guerilla focused too much on the number of weapons available and weapon attachments instead of focusing on gameplay. They also left out four important classes from the previous 2 games\, the medic\, the engineer\, the tactician and the infiltrator. Instead they rolled three of those classes into the support class and the infiltrator returned as the insurgent\, but it was no where near as good as the originals. Killzone 2 was fun. There were enough weapons and you could mix and match abilities with each class to play how you wanted to play. It was 32 player online which meant constant action. There was always a fight going on somewhere. Killzone 3 and SF were rather dull in that regard. Also\, you could do some real damage with rockets and the grenade launcher in Killzone 2. That was blast\, pun intended. You also got a grenade count of three. You can get extra throwables in SF\, but you have to buy them with valor as a boost and it only lasts one round. I also didn't like how I had to press right on the D-Pad to use stun blast. This felt awkward as you have to momentarily stop moving your toon to use the stun blast ability which leaves you vulnerable to attack. Multiplayer is about speed and mobility and you can't afford to stop moving even for a second. I haven't played the campaign mode so I can't review the game there. My primary focus is multiplayer. However\, I have heard that it's not that good. From what I do know about the story\, Helghan has become a lifeless rock which is uninhabitable. The Helghast were granted half of Vekta as their new home to make up for the atrocity committed during the war. I had hoped for something different at the end of Killzone 3. I was hoping the war would go to Earth and we'd get a Helghast campaign. Instead we got a story that made little sense. There's no way the VSA would allow the Helghast onto their homeworld because the two factions were bitter enemies. The original Killzone had the best story with Templar\, Luger\, Haaka\, and Rico. Killzone 2 was OK\, and Killzone 3 was more about Hollywood style action. I hope that we get a better Killzone 5 or a reboot of the series that picks up where Killzone 2 left off and does away with 3 and SF. I still gave the game an 8 though because the graphics are great\, the music is good\, the gameplay isn't as good as KZ2 but it's above average and has marked improvements in the series. The gave the support class a spawn beacon so there's no more base camping. They also give you the ability to create your own warzone.

And that's only when the directional objective marker actually feels like appearing (there were several times I tried to invoke it\, only to get a text display of my objective and nothing more). It can be more confusing than helpful at times\, especially when it rotates 360 degrees\, like when you're in outer space\, zero gravity or on a multi-level structure. And some of the mission objectives are just downright confusing. You'll get a vague hint like \""assist so and so\"" but it doesn't tell you that this assistance involves several steps that aren't very intuitive.The weapons for the most part are decent but there are major shortcomings. For instance\, the game loves to put you in rooms full of ammunition and weapons like you're in a candy store but you can only carry a ridiculously small supply. You get one primary weapon\, one secondary and a max capacity refill of reach. There are two types of grenades but you can only carry one type at a time. When you're looking at a weapon on the ground\, you can see the specs for it but the lame comparison leaves a lot to be desired. Instead of orange and green bars to indicate more or less power\, just do a side by side. The worst glitch with the weapons is that some of them will simply refuse stop working and refuse to fire. There is no explanation\, no little text message to say \""too close to target\"" an indication that the weapon is empty or anything. Nope\, you just sit there pressing R2 like a maniac while getting riddled by the enemy. As if ridiculous cheapness were';t enough\, the AI enemies even do little victory dances over your body and take cell phone pics of their kill. So after the game fails on you\, it celebrates its failure in tacky fashion.There are adrenaline packs that you can use during battle. They will restore your health and also give you a temporary slowed down Matrix style \""bullet time\"" boost. It's helpful when facing a few enemies but pretty much useless when needed most\, against scores of enemies as you'll encounter in the latter stages of the game. Like the weapons\, they also seem to disappear without warning when you need them most. I'll start a new section with a full supply of adrenaline packs but somehow go down and see the message \""no adrenaline packs available\"".The tactical echo and O.W.L. were the only two things that really stood out about the game and even they had their faults. They are usually excellent tools in your arsenal\, especially for helping deal with the darker environments. The tactical echo acts almost like a heat sensor\, displaying enemy silhouettes through walls\, doors or floors. The O.W.L. is your personal drone that is capable of providing a shield\, attacking enemies\, disabling enemy shields and hacking computer systems which accomplishes numerous objectives like disabling alarms\, opening doors\, navigating ships\, disabling security systems\, etc. Unfortunately\, when you use the most useful features like shield and pulse\, it quickly drains the O.W.L. and it will end up off in a corner recharging when you really need it. Also\, as far as engagement\, although it occasionally kills enemies\, (more in the beginning than latter stages)\, by the last few chapters of the game\, it amounts to little more than a distraction and hacking device. 99% of the enemies will need to be dispatched by you.All in all\, I played the game only because I paid for it. I can wholeheartedly say if this were offered free as a PS-Plus game of the month or some other deal\, I likely would have deleted it by now. I would not buy the game again if given the chance all over again\, but everyone has different tastes. My advice is to watch a couple play through videos online just to get a grasp of the environment you'll actually be playing in versus the much prettier environments shown in the ads. Might not hurt to rent it first as well\, if you're able to do so. Otherwise\, grab it in a bargain bin as cheap as possible or wait to see if Sony offers it as a free PS plus game (highly likely in the near future) if you simply must have it.However\, if frequently getting lost in dark environments with malfunctioning weapons and vague directives while having enemies twerk over your body and take cell phone pics after a ridiculously cheap kill seems like fun\, then dive on in. This is the game for you!… Expand"

Make no mistakes the vistas are stunning and at first glance the game will take your breath away but unfortunately this effect doesn't last.Firstly the parallel with history continues\, from the obvious Nazi/WW2 undertones of one through three this time a cold war scenario has arisen with the Helghan on one side of an enormous wall and the Vektans on the other both supposedly at peace whilst running covert ops that appear to be the least covert in all of history considering the amount captured people\, botched operations and indeed the player themselves being captured comes into play. The story dismisses this potentially interesting concept in favour of recreating another standard unremarkable plot of FPS staple based around some nondescript terrorist group who have decided to cause trouble because reasons.The plot is at best unremarkable leaving no considerable impact even when it sets itself up to do so\, threating mass catastrophe or death with a mission that despite the Shadow Marshals\, that is the Vektan Black Ops\, apparent multiple membership only the player character can be sent to do anything and as such it throws away the subtexts and smaller pieces in favour of pushing the ham fisted main storyline forwards in an absolutely nonsensical way particularly given from cutscenes alone if logic was applied the player should be dead several times over. The actual main plot is not enough to hold attention with several blaring gaps such as an early mission [*SPOILERS*] where trains are turned into mobile missiles and the Vektans lose control of the system but do not simply use the emergency stop to cut off electricity leaving them useless rather shovelling the player into obviously deliberate level design [*END SPOILERS*]Worse the human element of the story disintegrates as the player is thrust into the role of an elite soldier who can take on entire battalions alone\, defeat impossible odds etc and it all gives the game an inconsistent tone as one minute there is mass remonstration about the horrors of the Helghast and the atrocities of the continuing war then the game thrusts you into a fantastical situation demanding you defy all odds to save everyone. Its a very detached experience and the AI doesn't help one bit being very short on brains or programming as your allies refuse to move up unless you hit a trigger point twenty feet ahead of the logical regroup point or throw yourself headlong into enemy bullets for several minutes and in the few occasions you have help you almost wish you didn't.Having said that the gunplay is weighty and the balancing feels spot on\, they're not so heavy as in two nor are they as floaty as three and guerrilla must be commended for finding this balance. The levels compliment such gunplay being multi-dimensional and allowing multiple approaches across various floors and areas is a lot of fun only this gets removed in favour of linear corridors later on and there are still the unnecessary sequences which will frustrate turning into trial and error repeats of ill thought out areas. Largely however the level design is excellent and when combined with the gunplay extremely gratifying although enemies in wider areas respawn quicker than you can find ammo to remove them making it annoying when you clear an area for a flanking manoeuvre\, have to run from a grenade\, come back and everyone is alive once more.The game certainly attempts some innovation such as the OWL companion\, a standard roster of appropriately textured and excellent sounding space age weapons but refuses to go anywhere with what it innovates being unsure of the power of next gen as of yet which is to be expected but it still leaves the elements feeling a bit too empty particularly when they're coupled with a total lack of guidance. Normally games lead you by the hand to an excruciating degree\, but Killzone does the opposite with so much beauty on screen it's nearly impossible in some cases to work out where it is you're supposed to be going.There are also some RPG elements such as audio diaries and the like which add a nice overall tone and make the world seem more alive and draw you in with optional exposition to support the events around you in an attempt to connect them or to provide more information than the cutscenes alone and any such collectibles are welcome whatever the game may be undeniably adding to the experience.Ultimately killzone is a solid and graphically beautiful FPS that has some minor innovation but a bog standard plot\, forgettable characters and whilst a solid level design that for the most part is different and fun a lack of appreciation of its own depth in this respect at points. It is not by any means bad simply not the huge leap to next gen some may wish for.… Expand"

This game\, from a graphics and mechanics standpoint\, is the definition of a next-gen game.  They were freaking incredible\, the details in everything from rain dripping down a characters face\, to the tiny pebbles and cracks littered all over the rocky cliffs; it was absolutely insane.  Movement felt very realistic in that doing things like sprinting would make the screen move as if the character were actually running and not just floating as it feels in many other FPSs.As for the campaign\, I found the gameplay itself to be a lot of fun\, however there were several parts in it that were very non-first-person shooter\, that I felt took a little bit of the enjoyment out of the campaign.    The story was very tough to follow and found myself having no idea why I was doing what I was doing\, but at the same time I was enjoying myself (this also could be because I've never played a KIllzone game before).  There were some parts of the campaign that were challenging\, but overall I moved through the campaign with relative ease even when playing it on the hardest difficulty.  So while the story itself was difficult to follow and there were some parts of the campaign that had no right being in an FPS in the first place\, overall the gameplay was a lot of fun and definitely helped prepare me for the multiplayer.Personally LOVE the multiplayer in Killzone Shadow Fall.  I've been playing Warzone which is basically a combination of every FPS game type known to man combined into one single game.  So basically every 5 minutes or so the objective of the game changes from Team Deathmatch\, to Search and Destroy\, or to a Domination style game type\, to a beacon retrieval game type.  The game type utilizes every corner of the maps and with the objective constantly changing it keeps you on your feet and results in a really intense and enjoyable experience.  Multiplayer utilizes a lot of the guns\, abilities\, load out options that you experienced in the campaign as well as incorporates some new aspects as well\, still giving you that slight feeling of uniqueness.  Most\, if not all\, of the load outs abilities provide some benefit to you and your team so it does a good job of promoting group cooperation and allows for those high-five moments you get when assisting your buddies.  Overall I think the Killzone: Shadow Fall's multiplayer is extremely fun\, and think anyone that is a fan of online shooters would thoroughly enjoy this game.… Expand"

Slapping the descriptors \""free-form\"" and \""open-ended\"" onto level design in no way compensates for the complete lack of direction. I can't count of the number of times I got lost in each level. Nothing breaks the rhythm of an FPS like poor level design. Every time I was finally getting into the action\, a firefight would abruptly end with no indication as to where the hell I should go next. Admittedly\, the HUD will give you environmental markers if you tap up on the D-pad\, but this only adds to the broken rhythm. And why do the markers disappear to begin with?On top of the insipid levels\, the controls are sluggish and unintuitive. In particular\, the touchpad and HUD integration for the OWL sentry are both annoying and distracting (am I blasting those shielded Helghast with an EMP or shooting them?). I finally got the hang of the OWL\, but I was over 3/4s of the way through the game. Speaking of the OWL\, why does it allow you to zipline to map areas that result in instant death? I'll tell you why: poor level design.Killzone: Shadow Fall has a nugget of redemption in its pristine graphics\, but even then\, the environments feel devoid of life.

Your health is also not very clear as I've been killed without realising I was near death several times.Not everything's bad. The semi-openness of levels allows you to approach objectives from different directions or in different orders depending on the scenario\, but the story makes each scenario difficult to take even vaguely seriously\, especially after the ridiculous back story as to why the Helghast are there in the first place.The game's worthy of a rental if you're bored\, but I'd recommend Wolfenstein over it.… Expand"

And sadly\, I was incredibly disappointed.But let's go over all the aspects.The plot. It's terrible and formulaic with a bland protagonist (unlike many other FPS's he can talk\, but God\, I wish he couldn't) and boring supporting characters. The ending deserves further berating\, but that'd mean spoilers. Just know that this is one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a game\, somewhat akin to Mass Effect 3.The gameplay. Shadow Fall is different from Killzone 3 in many ways. Instead of being a fun rollercoaster ride\, it now (allegedly) offers more freedom of choice and tactical options. The sad thing is that in theory updating gameplay in a longgoing series this way should be refreshing\, but in reality\, it is just outright boring and irritating. For instance\, you are given an ability to drop-kill and throw a knife after meelee. (Yes\, exactly as in Far Cry 3)\, but in practice you can hardly use it in stealth because it is virtually non-existent (You'll be lucky to stealth-kill just one Helghast soldier\, they'll spot you right after) or in action because going out of cover to meelee will get you killed in no time. I would specifically like to point out the terrible enemy AI\, who just doesn't know of the self-preservation instinct\, just running straight up to you. Oh\, and another thing - as most modern shooters\, you can carry two weapons in Shadow Fall. But unlike those shooters\, you can freely swap only one of those\, with your default gun being stuck with you throughout most of the game. Whoever thought this'd be a good idea was probably a moron.Level design. I just wanted to cover this separately\, because it's terrible. The levels are good-looking alright\, but hard to navigate (No map in singleplayer). Moreover\, Guerilla somewhy decided that forcing you do defend some point against waves of mindless Helghast like five times in the campaign would be fun. It's not. I've felt extremely frustrated in each of those encounters\, especially in Chapter 7.Graphics. No complaints here. KZ3 was a pretty game and SF easily outmatches it with sharp textures and amazing effects. Just the view on Vekta city in the first levels of the game is breathtaking.Multiplayer. Exactly the same as in Killzone 3. The DLC model is different\, yes\, with maps being free but game modes and player classes being paid. But it's nothing special.In other words\, this was a huge drop of the bar. While Killzone 3 (I haven't played 1&2) wasn't a system-seller\, it was still a well-made enjoyable and entertaining shooter. Shadow Fall\, however\, is more of a tech demo\, it's neither a system-seller\, nor even something worth picking up when you buy yourself a PS4.… Expand"

Killzone: Shadow does some new and different things that are great\, but it also still has some short comings that the series is know for.… Expand"

94808,9,"Killzone Shadow Fall is without a doubt the best FPS available on the next gen consoles so far. Previously\, I have preferred Battlefield or Call of Duty to the Killzone series and I have put a lot of hours into all three games. Killzone has the best story of the three as well as the most fun multiplayer of the three. If you are not a fan of FPS games\, then this game certainly won't doKillzone Shadow Fall is without a doubt the best FPS available on the next gen consoles so far. Previously\, I have preferred Battlefield or Call of Duty to the Killzone series and I have put a lot of hours into all three games. Killzone has the best story of the three as well as the most fun multiplayer of the three. If you are not a fan of FPS games\, then this game certainly won't do anything to change your mind about the genre.The graphics are outstanding\, but with it being a launch game\, there are some imperfections. You can definitely tell where Guerrilla Games skipped over adding more detail in order to ensure the games release date. One such occasion is when you fly over Vekta City and the streets are lifeless. Lights that you would see representing a city from above in previous generation games are used instead of more detailed ones that you would expect. That being said\, the parts of the game that received Guerrilla Games full attention are spectacular and at times\, jaw dropping. If this is one of the first games to arrive for the PS4\, then I am genuinely excited to see what comes out at the end of this console cycle.Gameplay is solid. Killzone controls have never been about speed and twitchiness which doesn't suit everyone. Instead\, Killzone goes for a more realistic feel to the game and it shows. The controls are responsive\, but don't expect to turn around in a split second. The guns feel weighty\, and the bigger the gun\, the more it shows. The inclusion of the multi-purpose rifle is great and definitely makes Killzone Shadow Fall feel like a futuristic game.The AI in this game is brutal (in a good way). How you can tell if someone has played the game or not comes down to what they say about the AI\, because if anyone talks about it being bad\, they have not played the game. If you do not plan out approach to each level\, you will get slaughtered. Even on normal difficulty\, some parts of the game can be difficult to get by if you are a casual gamer with limited FPS experience. The enemies rarely miss and will find angles to shoot you if you take cover. This is done to force games to use the OWL\, a multi-purpose bot that you will need to use to beat the campaign. Using the touchpad to control the OWL is a breeze\, but there are times when the touchpad seems to be too sensitive and picks up commands that you didn't order. GG combatted this by forcing you to use the L1 button in order for the bot to carry out the command.The multiplayer aspect of this game is where you are likely to spend hours\, and Killzone delivers here. The multiplayer is very customizable and doesn't force you to level up in order to unlock new weapons/abilities. This provides the game with limited barriers to entry\, which is necessary for a launch game. Providing everyone with the same abilities and weapons means that you shouldn't have any issues with players who have spent hours in the game destroying you because of superior weapons and abilities. All that being said\, GG has offered tons of challenges for players to try out. Completing these challenges allows you to increase your level and distinguish you from the rest. Multiplayer is a blast and on it's own would be enough to warrant a purchase if you are a fan of playing FPS online.If you have recently gotten a PS4 and are looking for a very fun game to play that can keep you occupied fr hours until the next PS4 games arrive in 2014\, then Killzone Shadow Fall is the perfect game for you provided that you don't expect perfection with a launch game. Killzone has its flaws\, but overall it earns it's score of 9.… Expand"

If you are hesitant on buying the game\, at least hear me out and decide for yourself. I encourage everyone to look at multiple reviews instead of just lazily picking one review and deciding not to buy the game.I'll start with the single player. It's a step up from KZ2 and KZ3 (unless you enjoyed those two). It's definitely not linear like KZ2/3 in that the maps are much bigger and you are given choices as to how to infiltrate enemy territory. As a Shadow Marshall\, your best choice is to play it discreet and to try to avoid going Rambo on a platoon of Helghast as opposed to KZ2/3 where you basically go CoDdudebro throughout those campaigns. And personally\, I like it. You also have a robotic weapon companion called the OWL which basically acts as your personal drone and life support. It really comes in handy for those parts where you're up against many Helghast in that you can set the OWL to attack enemies and distract them while you take out the rest.The game's story progresses in chapters and each chapter is a new map/level. The game mixes between Vekta/New Helghan maps and space maps where you're in an ISA Cruiser or a giant space laboratory. Personally\, I absolutely LOVED the chapters in space. The feel\, the atmosphere and the art direction in those chapters felt very sci-fi eery; almost like Metroid Prime (which I find to be a very good thing). I loved going through the abandoned ISA Cruiser and reading the eery messages that the crew left behind on the walls\, especially this one downright disturbing Audiolog in one of the rooms which simply captured the atmosphere perfectly. I won't go behind the story in those chapters since they're somewhat spoilers. The soundtrack in this game is also amazing and won't disappoint since it also seems to capture that 'Metroid Prime' feel that I described earlier.The controls in Shadow Fall also don't feel as heavy as they did in KZ2/3. Controls are responsive; swiping the touch pad to give your OWL orders is easy. Shooting feels great. The only thing they could have worked on more was the cover system but other than that\, gameplay is pretty much flawless IMO.Multiplayer is pretty much a blast. They incorporated new game mechanics like shields and speed power ups. It's your standard Killzone MP but with much more game modes incorporated into it. Weapons and game searches are customizable. It's much faster getting into an MP match. Map designs are also new and they even include a few old ones from KZ2/3 such as the map \""Ruins\"".All in all\, I very much enjoyed my time with Killzone Shadow Fall and will continue to do so for MP. The graphics are downright amazing and mesmerizing and runs very fluidly at a consistent framerate AND in 1080p. Pick this game up if you're getting a PS4.… Expand"

The new KZ offers the best of gameplay and graphics of contemporary shooters. That is not to say it's perfect\, or even close to\, as there is definitively room for improvement in story-telling and campaign design. However\, other franchise titles such as CoD and BF4\, which have long since become stale\, still get their above average good reviews\, whereas KZ gets knocked for all its shortcomings. What game does not have shortcomings? Otherwise\, what would be the point of a sequel?I won't go into how good it looks; simply put\, the best-looking console game to date. But rather\, I would like to emphasize the very good game design and features(such as the OWL)\, its great gun handling and tight controls\, the varied level locales\, as well as its visual style. The audio balance is off\, it's true\, and that is disappointing. Some of the acting is unconvincing\, but for the most part the interesting story is well told. Anyone who laments a boring story setting has simply not been paying attention\, or cannot color out its meaning(seen and unseen). Enough of spoon fed story-telling\, thank you! Some people have lamented too-open level design; to those\, I say\, stick with Doom. Others have complained of not enough checkpoints; which is ridiculous\, since not enough games present any challenge with an over-abundance thereof. No\, Guerrilla has done everything right\, especially considering the constraints and pressures of releasing a launch title.As I have mentioned before\, there are faults that need be addressed(and surely will in a sequel)\, but the good in this game evidently outweighs any bad. Furthermore\, I need to mention some complaints critics expressed over the non-shooter gameplay sequences in this game: first\, there are few non-shooter moments in the game(hardly enough to make a fuss over)\, second\, these elements are by no means bad! People fussed over the anti-gravity sections. Really?!! They are there purely for atmospheric reasons and\, that in mind\, work great! Of the platforming sequences I can only express that I wished for more\, and the free fall moments were too few and short to mention(positive or negative). So where exactly does the negativity stem from? Why the hate on KZ? Especially when mediocre\, morally bankrupt games like CoD get(still!!) good reviews. Morally bankrupt because it is the selling of propaganda of an invading force killing people with the sole justification that(hey!) it's America doing the killing. Could I please play a Middle Easterner killing Americans who destroyed his home and family? No? I guess that's not PC. Well\, give me a great fantasy shooter with more realistic gun-play any day\, thanks.PS: I did not forget multiplayer\, but as I have yet to play it any significant amount I cannot comment on it. Overall\, my review of a 9 is based solely on the excellent single player campaign. Thanks for a great launch title and overall great game Guerrilla! Don't listen to the fools!!… Expand"

Keep in mind that the developpers worked on this game for only two years and a half\, and most of the time on an uncomplete hardware.The framerate is also very good\, and I say that as a PC gamer. It never goes under 30fps\, but can go way above that. And that can be a little problem if you prefer a stable framerate. Most of the time\, it goes up and down between 30 and 45. But it doesn't affect the experience at all\, trust me.The main campaign story is also very good  It's not as good as TLOU's story (for example)\, and by far\, but it's still very enjoyable. And compared to the previous Killzone\, needless to say it's way better. The characters are also well made (I just LOVE Echo)\, and their animations (body and face) are very well done. Kudos to Guerrilla for the graphics of this game\, it's just amazing.The musics are very good as well\, each side of the wall has it's own musical ambiance. The gunshots also sound amazing\, you can hear the echo in each room\, and it's never the exact same sound\, since the architecture of the room has an influence on it. A small detail\, but still impressive.Personnally\, I didn't even rush the campaign\, and I finished it on Normal difficulty in about 11 hours. Oh\, and by the way\, this game can be heard sometimes. Like VERY hard. Not going to spoil anything\, but some levels may just make you rage. I personnally liked that\, it gave a little old school feeling to the game.So for the single player mode\, it's a 9/10.And now the multiplayer. First of all\, the graphical difference between SP and MP is barely noticeable. Maybe a few particle effects removes\, and the volumetric lights aren's as good\, but it's still gorgeous. And the framerate is 40-60 fps. Still a bit unstable\, but still very smooth.The Warzone is just perfect\, in my opinion. You can literally do whatever you want: choose the amount of players\, the rules\, the weapons available\, etc... And there are TONS of obectives to complete. If I remember well\, the exact number is 1500. Quite a lot\, if you ask me.And for the ones who are worrying about the heavy gameplay\, it's gone. It's still not as fast as some other FPS\, but it's better this way imo: it's just more realistic. You're no Flash Gordon\, you actually feel like you have a weight\, and a body.I give the MP a 10/10\, because I'm already having a blast playing it. And as for the PSN issues\, I didn't get any\, same thing for the players I played with or against. Lucky me\, I guess.So\, this game is\, by far\, the best of the series. I liked KZ 2\, but KZ SF just send it back to Kindergarten\, playing with little rocks.I'm going to insist on this\, but I'm a PC gamer\, and I'm quite used to see beautiful games\, but Killzone Shadow Fall is simply gorgeous. It's a very good thing\, considering it's a lauch game. I just can't wait to see what the next games will look like\, but this is very promising.The framerate is smooth\, but suffers little drops sometimes\, but nothing really bad.In a nutshell\, this game is awesome. Already a must have for every PS4 owner.Oh\, and by the way\, don't mind the average score (7.7 when I wrote this review)\, because a  ton of trolls just give it 0s because they can't stand the truth. Probably PC trolls\, or Xbox trolls\, I don't know\, but they're all idiots\, regardless of the platform they play on.Straight 10/10\, I really enjoyed myself on this game\, and I'm going to enjoy myself even more in the days and weeks to come.

I always think of Helgans as the good guys in Killzone because of their back story which is actually reflected a lot in this games story. now a spoiler which is my reason behind this is because in one mission of the game you actually play as a Helgan on a stealth mission. I loved this mission and I wished is there were more missions like this cause as the Helgan you had a invisibility cloak that made it more fun. The use of the owl was a interesting feature with the touch pad which I would like to see similar integration in other video games. the combat in Killzone seems the same as ever with a few tweaks. I do miss the use of Co-Op in the two previous games that myself and my best friend use to enjoy.

94944,6,"No sense of direction\, easy to get lost\,. Also\, the game handles darkness badly. Together\, these two factors make it really frustrating. Also some out of place zero gravity sections\, which feel weird. Stealth is messed up. Worst game in the Killzone series. Wanted to love it."

Other than visuals\, KSF does nothing right. Silly story. Boring combat. Bland weapons. Dumb AI. Dead multiplayer. Terrible music. Sigh. KSF is a last gen game ported over to the PS4. Developers continue to rehash tired conceptsShadow Fall is the first game Killzone game I've played. It’s terrible. Sure it looks good\, but that’s not a selling point because many games look great nowadays. Other than visuals\, KSF does nothing right. Silly story. Boring combat. Bland weapons. Dumb AI. Dead multiplayer. Terrible music. Sigh. KSF is a last gen game ported over to the PS4. Developers continue to rehash tired concepts despite powerful console hardware at their disposal.The protagonist\, Kellar\, is a mindless drone killing his way to the truth. He is a super soldier with a few high tech abilities and nifty armor. The armor looks similar to the nanosuit in Crysis\, but it’s all for show. I couldn’t help reminiscing about the first Crysis game I played: Crysis 2 on the Xbox 360. Unlike Shadow Fall\, Crysis 2 blew me away.  It launched 3 years prior to KSF on significantly weaker hardware\, and Crysis does nearly everything better. It’s an impressive 360 game on many levels. Visuals are still top tier. Combat is varied and satisfying. Multiplayer is solid and criminally underrated. And that nanosuit… The hero feels like a badass because the nanosuit provides multiple tactical options to clear levels. Not Kellar however. His mobility is so limited that KSF plays like an on rails shooter. What a shame. Kellar's world is comprised of beautiful set pieces he can’t explore. Why develop such intricate levels just to lock players out?Visuals are solid\, but that’s because the world is bathed in fancy lighting effects. Without them\, things don’t look better than any other game. Lens flare and other ornamental effects are nothing more than parlor tricks. Now that consoles can push these out with relative ease\, developers simply can’t control themselves. Unfortunately\, KSF’s campaign performance hovers around 30fps. COD Ghosts launched at the same time and feels noticeably smoother. That’s because developer Infinity Ward focused on the 60fps benchmark. I absolutely hated Ghosts\, but it feels responsive compared to KSF’s heavy controls.So that leads into gameplay\, which is clunky and awful. Kellar constantly loses his weapons\, so he is forced to improvise. All this does is force the already sluggish campaign to a crawl. These missions usually entail sneaking around areas completely devoid of people\, enemies\, and anything else. Exploration is nil despite all the fences\, doors\, airlocks\, curtains\, that look accessible but aren’t. Crates will be neatly stacked next to a low wall\, but alas our super soldier can’t climb them. A few missions occur in a futuristic shanty town with blankets draped over doorways. Of course\, Kellar can’t pass thru these indestructible cloth obstacles.Truth be told\, the campaign is a mind-numbingly tedious slog. Most of it is spent walking around. Enemies are sparse. I’d say 70% of the game is spent not doing much of anything. When combat happens\, it’s hampered by sluggish controls and predictably stupid enemy AI.Kellar gets a unique situational ability per level\, like repelling or floating thru space or using a sniper rifle. Yawn. I’ve read comments were fans say all this “keeps things interesting”. But all that “interesting” excitement occurs in very short bursts limited to specific set pieces. Kellar got to repel. Once. OMG!! How interesting! Not. Many popular shooters (cough\, COD\, cough) are guilty of the same crime. They keep things simple and safe for the kiddies but throw in a cool feature or cutscene every hour or so to rope them in that much longer.The story is stuffed full of commentary reflecting specific contemporary events. Guerilla shamelessly thrusts political messages into gamers’ faces. At one point\, I was expecting the word “privilege” to surface\, but I don’t think it ever did. Guerilla addresses the pointlessness of violence while using a violent “M” rated game as the medium. How ironic? Oh wait\, DICE did the same thing in Battlefield 1. Not every company needs to inject itself into the public discourse.The multiplayer is better than expected. It’s a ghost town these days\, but enough people get on to keep things up and running. Too bad I missed out on it when it launched.With only a few missions to go\, I encountered a game breaking glitch. I couldn’t complete a mission. After multiple failed retries\, I finally consulted the almighty Google. Sure enough\, KSF has bugs that can prevent players from completing the game. Three years after launch\, these bugs still exist. Unfortunately\, I was able to fix the glitch and complete the game.To conclude\, Killzone Shadow Fall is a glorified tech demo with nothing to offer. Guerrilla obviously lost its way. If anything has stalled next gen innovation\, it’s developers afraid to take risks. I installed Crysis 2 on my pc to cleanse myself of this awful experience. Despite its age\, Crysis 2 still holds up. Buy that instead.… Expand"

It feels incredibly balanced due to all weapons and abilities being available from the start\, but there is enough reward through unlockable attachments and 1\,500+ challenges that keep the addiction level high. Playing as each of the game's three classes is never tiresome and always engaging regardless of which I choose. This can be attributed to the great set of abilities each class posses that at times can feel like you're on a Call of Duty killstreak with the drones\, turrets\, missiles\, and air-support that is instantly available to you.Teamwork is a big factor in the outcome of matches\, depending on which mode you're playing\, but the core mechanics of what each player should be doing are clear enough that voice chat is not at all a necessity to do well. Map design is great and makes it so you are basically never getting kills by running around in circles shooting people in the back like in Call of Duty. The firefights are very deliberate and often volley between two fronts\, offering up some hectic battles and intensely risky behind-enemy-lines tactics. Uh...yeah\, it's great!CAMPAIGN:Because the older Killzone games didn't really aspire to much aside from loud guns and slick graphics (namely 2 and 3)\, they end up being solid\, albiet unambitious\, shooters. I consider the original trilogy to be an incredible set of games that doesn't do much\, but does it all with a raw simplicity and challenge that hits the spot. They are why I was super anxious to get my hands on Killzone: Shadow Fall.With a new console\, however\, another formulaic entry to the series just wouldn't cut it\, especially with a game that spearheads the system launch. Thankfully\, Guerrilla games decided to tinker with the core-Killzone mechanics and give players something new. Shadow Fall takes you out of the boots of the frontline grunts of the previous games and throws the player into the role of a Shadow Marshall\, a kind of lone-wolf spec ops soldier with a slew of gadgets and abilities to help get each mission done. Not only that\, but the levels were to be such that the player could engage the enemy on their own terms\, without be pushed along by squadmates as you would before.In theory\, it all sounded great to me\, but in practice\, there's something amiss. Well\, not any one thing in particular\, but many many little things. Guerrilla seems out of their element\, and each new gameplay element introduced over the course of the campaign yields a series of small missteps. And...I don't wanna type anymore. List time!Pros:- Nice graphics- Very balanced multiplayer with good map design\, unique abilities and upgrades- Gun controls are ultra-responsive- The OWL drone is cool when it works- The Spoor gun is designed very wellCons:- OWL drone is very temperamental about when it will work and is thus very unreliable- Can't hear anything anyone is saying\, even with the music and SFX turned down..have to use sub-titiles- Lots of rocks\, poles\, chairs\, and other pointless things in the environment to get stuck on- Overall amount of gun combat is relatively low- Too many dark levels\, all without a flashlight- \""Stealth\"" mission paths that can't be completed with stealth- \""Simon says\"" -type \""do-what-I-say-or-die\"" levels with Echo\, even though she is hot- Some very poor pacing in the campaign make for some agonizingly drawn out pointless scenes- Music is noticeably absent in many parts of the campaign\, and doesn't contribute much to the overall atmosphere when present- D-pad can be unresponsive in multiplayer… Expand"

I'm a PC gamer so I'm used to awesome graphics\, so Killzone surprised me a bit because it looks almost identical to Crysis 3. The lighting and textures and especially the lens flares. The game is very different from Crysis 3 though. In some cases I would say Killzone is better graphically\, which is pretty amazing.Single Player- So this game definitely has the graphics. But does it have the gameplay? Yes it does. From BF4 to COD: Ghosts\, I started playing the single player campaign and eventually after a few chapters I quit playing. It was just too boring and not fun at all. There is nothing to challenge you in those games. It's just \""Shoot this guy\""\, \""Now shoot that guy\"". Killzone is some of that too(but a lot prettier) but you also get a bot to use in different ways which definitely spices up game play a lot(using the bot helps A LOT) and you also play a bit stealthy sometimes which I LOVE. I just wish they used more of it. So I fully completed the SP\, and I plan to play the SP again on Medium. I played it first on hard but it was almost TOO hard to enjoy sometimes. I recommend playing on Medium. The SP actually gets you thinking\, and you must die a few times to actually develop new schemes to try and complete the objective. I also absolutely LOVED the final chapter of the game\, it's a completely stealth chapter but I won't give away the objective as it's an AWESOME objective too and a GREAT ending to a really fun single player campaign.Multiplayer- The MP of Killzone is a good bit different from BF4 and COD: Ghosts. And I find my self enjoying it a lot. In BF4 and COD\, I find that you die so fast in those games(especially COD). It's like a bunch of people running around like headless chickens(which can be fun sometimes\, I play both BF4 and COD: Ghosts). But Killzone is a bit more than that. For one you have all sorts of different devices such as shields and bots\, which if you take good advantage of them they help you a lot. None of the guns are really that OP\, and with a normal Assault Rifle it takes a good while to kill someone. You'd have to keep hitting them straight on for about 2 seconds to kill them and a lot more than that if your only landing every other shot. Being that it's a lot harder for you to die\, I think that makes the game more about skill than just fast reflex's. Keep in mind I'm good at both COD and BF4\, with a greater than 1 K/D ratio in both\, and I like both of those games\, but I also like Killzone's MP\, and I find myself playing a lot of it. Is it better? No\, but it's different so you can't really directly compare.Negatives about the game- One definite negative is that the multiplayer portion of the game only runs at 960x1080p. Which is about 10% more pixels than 1280x720p. So at least it's not 720p. But I really wish it were at least 1600x900p. Because you CAN for SURE tell the difference between how CRISP single player looks and how multi player looks a LITTLE blurry. So this is somewhat of a big deal for me. Most XBox fans think pixels don't matter at all\, I BEG TO DIFFER cause it's obvious to me and I can't stand anything under 1600x900. But they way they made it 960x1080\, they did it very smartly\, so it doesn't look all that bad but it is a negative for sure. And the only negative I can really gripe about because I love the game. You may not be able to tell if you watch a youtube video of this\, but if your playing in front of your 60 inch screen like I am\, the difference is almost night and day to an everyday gamer.I wasn't expecting much from KZ: Shadow Fall. But it did impress me. I got this game in a bundle for my PS4 so it's not like I was really wanting it. But I'm glad I got it cause it's constantly inside my PS4 being played.Overall I think this games an 8.5/10\, but because some people are giving it a 0\, I'm giving it a 10.Whoever gives this game less than a 6 or 7\, simply don't know what a TRULY good game is.… Expand"

This is why it takes so long in a consoles life to figure out how to make the best games. Like last of us launching this year instead of a few after the ps3 launches.) This caliber of game just does not come out when a console is born. the graphics are outstanding\, not a framrate clip\, stutter\, skip\, whatever. It just flows beautifully from scene to scene\, even in the multiplayer warzones where people are joining/quiting non stop.the campaign is your standard FPS save the world super human style. Its presented in a fashion that isn;t too unknown to any last-gen shooter apocalypse player. lone wolf soldier with minimal assistance takes on hordes of alien attackers in an attempt to help humanity. The cold war aspect with the berlin wall and such give an interesting twist to the narrative. I did not play the previous killzones so it was harder to get a feel for the hatred against the aliens(helgast) who attacked us first\, and in the last game we had destroyed their planet. The game does a good job of making you feel for them as to why they'd want to cross the wall and take over the planet. The game doesn't do much to improve anything in terms of FPS gameplay aside from giving you your OWL companion(word to the wise\, learn how to use immediately)\, but what it does do is make everything look fun and gorgeous while you blow stuff up. The difficulty is a bit higher than most FPS on normal but nothing unfair. The game has a nice pace to it with random rail scenarios to break up the tandum. Overall the campaign doesn't shine as say the original modern warfare does\, but it's well worth the playh through.The multiplayer is basic\, and honestly I kind of like that. Instead of picking a certain map type\, you can join a warzone that can contain anywhere from 1-8 game types. These ranging from deathmatch to headquarter control\, to destroying checkpoints. The randomness of these warzones really is what makes the game fun to me. You're always wondering what you'll have to do next and this makes the tactical advantages of certain maps great because they might not be as good depending on what type of match you are in. Things run super smooth and fast\, I do feel there are some over powered special abilities but what game doesn't have at least one.If you;'re buying a ps4 you owe it to yourself to give this game a try\, if just for the spectacle of how gorgeous frame by frame it is.… Expand"

For the most part\, these remarks about Killzone are true and perhaps its only true advancement over any previous console FPS is the gorgeous graphics. But heres the bit that bothers me the most\, Call of Duty\, the widely successful and hugely popular first person shooter franchise has been at its very core\, essentially the same game and its innovations are mainly materialistic and cosmetic rather than anything ever truly revolutionary. Despite this Call of Duty will consistently score very high scores and primarily by the notion that \""if it aint broke\, don't fix it\"". So whilst I completely agree that Killzone doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table\, the sheer fact it is penalised for not innovating on past Killzones (or any FPS's for that matter) whilst CoD can be accused of innovating just as little\, all whilst maintaining its generally high review scores\, is absolutely staggering. I can't help but feel that killzone is perhaps penalised for the sheer fact its a ''next gen\"" game\, rather than on the merits it brings primarily as a video game. Would it have scored higher if it was on PS3? Most probably. Is it worth buying a PS4? Perhaps not. If it was called Call of Duty: Shadow Fall would reviewers have scored it higher? Most likely... Is it a worthwhile and solid shooter that offers you a solid sic-fi esque experience? Yes. If I like shooters and want something my current gen console doesn't already offer should i buy Killzone?

It gives me a happy medium ofMy Full Killzone Review! (Multiplayer Included) (Minimal Spoilers)Let me start off by saying Next Gen has finally arrived and dang it feels great! I am so excited to see what's to come of these consoles and the games that come out on them.Campaign:I started up the campaign and decide to play on normal which is what I do for almost all games I play. It gives me a happy medium of difficulty without taking away from the story. The game started up with a little video of what you have missed since the 30 years from Killzone 3. Honestly after the video I was still a little confused about what was going on. Which lets me tell you that you don't need to play the other 3 to understand this one. Once the video was over I took control of a child. I was in what appeared to be my house and was looking out a window at the Helghast detaining people and moving them into a cage. I turn and look to my left and see a man which appears to be my father. He calls me Lucas and informs me that we need to go and that we can only take what we need. He keeps telling me we will be safe once we get to the other side of the wall. As we move out of my room the front door starts rattling with forceful Knocks. The person on the otherwise of the door keep yelling\, \""Open Up!\"" My dad says\, We have to move now!\"" You spend a good amount of time working your way to the wall trying not to get caught.After some unfortunate events that occur you soon start playing as the grown up version of the Lucas. I'd say he is now in his mid twenties. You are the youngest to be accepted into the Shadow Marshall and are proven to be a real asset to the raging war. I now realize that we are in a constant war with the Helghast. The people on the other side of the wall (YOU) are called Vekten. We supposedly took their planet from them and they want it back.While playing through the game I didn't feel very attached to the story. It seemed pointless at times and sometimes just to many errands to run before I could leave an area. It got a little repetitive in the sense you always had to go turn this off or destroy this. What didn't help any is that the A.I. Was horrid and acted so dumb. It wasn't until around chapter 6 where the story got a little better and tried to recover from the rocky start. It however was too late to save it. Towards the end of the game I just wanted to be done with it so I could say I beat it.Once I completed Chapter 9 I thought the game was over. The credits started rolling and I was left confused and frustrated. I felt like I did all this work and achieved nothing. Then all of the sudden the credits got hacked and I was back in for Chapter 10. I must say I was relieved that it didn't end the way I thought it did.All in all the story wasn't half bad but at the same time wasn't anything to run home about. It really had trouble keeping me involved and interested which left me feeling bored throughout the game. It had its moments but not enough to keep the story alive.Graphics:Not much needs to be said here. The graphics were on par and probably some of the best I've seen for any game. It seems like they spent a lot of time perfecting the lighting and the detail to the objects and environment. I could easily tell this was a true next gen game.A few things I noticed is it had some slight frame rate issues when the environment was collapsing. Also I noticed when you looked out yonder it was very pixelated and smeared together. Now the only thing that bugged me was the cut scenes looked worse the the actual gameplay. I have never seen anything like this. It is usually the exact opposite. I don't understand how this happened but it seemed like they rushed them. They were clunky and not very well put together.Other then those few things I was impressed with the detail and it blows my mind that this is the first game out on the console. I can't wait to see how they improve and polish. I believe we can get even better looking titles.Gameplay:This is were the game lacked. It had so many problems that it felt like a drag just to play. I had so many times were I had to reload checkpoints because I would get stuck or things wouldn't happen that were supposed to happen.Don't even get me started on the A.I.! They were horrible and quite frankly unacceptable. This is a next gen game... Why are the A.I. some of the worst I have ever seen. It seems like to me they spent all their time on the graphics and not a lot of time on anything else. This is no way of launching a title to start off the next generation of gaming. Let me give you an example of how bad these A.I. were. I happened to be sneaking around from cover to cover and accidentally walked right out in front of 3 enemies. I literally froze and waited for them to shoot my face in. One of them said\, \""I think I see something.\"" The other 2 are oblivious to what is going on. He sits there and moves his body from left to right as if he was trying to see better. Now at this point I think to myself\, why haven't I died yet. I am standing 5 feet from 3 enemies in plain sight and they can't see me? Just an FYI it was not at all dark. I was outside in the beaming sun standing right in front of these 3 Helghast. I decide to test my luck and melee the first enemy. Once again the other 2 are oblivious to what is happening. I then shoot the other 2 and somehow make it out of there without a bullet being shot at me. Now this wasn't the only time this happened. They either were really blind or could see you across the map. It got really annoying and made me rage a few times.Now here is something that really bugged me as well. Why the heck aren't we allowed to activate the flashlight on your gun or suit? Most of the time I would be in an area that is pitch black and is almost impossible to navigate. I had to turn up my gamma so much just to see that it made the graphics look bad. Sometimes your objective marker wouldn't even show up so you would have to roam around until you found the right way which was very hard to do in the dark.Multiplayer:When I went to the multiplayer menu I noticed there wasn't any customization tab for your character or a load out menu or anything. I decided to just jump in a match. It automatically put me in with some random class. I then found out I could pause the game and change my class. They had a bunch of random classes but none that you could make on you own. Also I noticed after playing a few matches that there wasn't any progressive leveling system. It was just accomplish certain challenges. I didn't really like the whole multiplayer layout. However the gameplay was smooth and the graphics were just as good as the campaign and that is something you don't see everyday. They had a couple game mode but not enough to keep me interested. I got bored of the multiplayer fast. I decided to go back and play the Campaign again.Conclusion:In the end the game was just alright. It had its ups and downs. The only thing that this game really shines in is the graphics. I would recommend this game if you were renting it or if the price comes down. I wouldn't spend $65 on it. However if you dying for a game to play on the next gen then by all means have at it. It isn't a terrible choice.Verdict: 1-10 (10 Being The Best)Campaign  7Graphics  9Gameplay  6Multiplayer  5Average Score 6.75Second Look:\nI decided to play the campaign through again but this time on Hard difficulty.

The game offers some of the most impressive visual moments I've ever seen\, tackling Crysis' visual depth as well as offering blockbuster vistas and stunning cityscapes. The transition between Vekta's crisp pure white city filled with crystal glass and lush foliage to New Helghan's hellishly industrial\, dingy\, rust-laden world of iron and steam is striking\, with the Helghan forces taking on new terrifying forms with incredible detail and striking new designs. Fans of the series will love the attention to detail\, but as someone who has vaguely dabbled in Killzone games previously\, only to be disappointed\, this is no change from the usual modus operandi of Killzone  look pretty\, shift copies. The online feels vaguely unique with some impressive map design but hardly a stellar\, game changing new addition to a sea of games that have devoted a lot of time to an online that clearly received a great deal of attention and care\, but lack anything new\, to the detriment of the single-player mode.The game's controls feel impressive\, utilising the PS4's touchscreen to control an automated assistant to carry out a series of tasks with a flick of a finger. Empowering\, to say the least. The game also uses the PS4 controller's light as a conveyance of health. Green for healthy\, yellow for hurt\, red for in danger\, and flashing red for almost-dead. The game's sound is impressive\, with a vivid and full bodied plethora of sounds to help further drive home the contrast between the rustling of trees and crunch of leaves to the clunking of metal underfoot. The game's soundtrack also offers sweeping orchestral pieces alongside some rather heavy-going modulated bassy tracks to really get the heart racing as you shoot down bullet trains and fly through the city hanging from a rappel line.The game seems to try and be more than it is. It's addition to the line of Killzone games offers a rewarding experience to determined players with a nice ability to offer varying locales for the different missions\, but at a cost. The plot feels jarringly odd. The same things seem to happen again and again as you pursue a wanted Helghan anarchist\, who seems to disarm you and render you incapable of fighting back by merely looking at you more than once in the game. Irritating to say the least. The characters switch loyalties with very little narrative until much later\, sparing only enough time to say they've changed sides\, and leaving it at that. The huge worlds are cut down almost instantly by irritatingly constrictive and agitating map design and fiddly \""what\, where am I going?\"" moments that have you hammering the objective button to bring up the onscreen directional prompt to rescue you.The game feels plagued by a sense of 'all-shine-no-substance'. The game is gorgeous and sounds incredible but playing it feels uncomfortable and some of the plot seems awfully repetitive. Single player segments of games are being rushed and utterly ignored as standard with the new generation of consoles\, and this is no exception.… Expand"

But once you get used to the shiny next gen graphics\, You’ll realise that there’s not really a whole lot of substance under all that style. This is a shining example of a series that has discarded its identity for a grab at mass appeal. It's perfectly decent but painfully generic. Everything inKillzone Shadowfall is one of the most visually stunning shooters to ever grace a console. But once you get used to the shiny next gen graphics\, You’ll realise that there’s not really a whole lot of substance under all that style. This is a shining example of a series that has discarded its identity for a grab at mass appeal. It's perfectly decent but painfully generic. Everything in Shadowfall has been done better somewhere else already.The good:For a launch title to look this glorious really does give one something to look forward to. Textures are razor sharp\, lighting is amazing and colours are vibrant and warm. It’s ironic how good and prominent the lighting is in a game called SHADOWfall.The helghast: character models for this faction are detailed and believable. The assault has streamlined armour plating and a predator like visage\, the recon wears a cloak and has small lenses to make him less visible whilst the support boasts heavy armour and additional ammo on his person (visual only\, though he is the ammo box guy).Class balance: the way that classes have been handled here is excellent and well thought out. Each has a myriad of interesting options that make sense for the role that they are supposed to play. Though the turret and air support of the support class are very close to being OP\, they don’t quite cross that line.All guns unlocked from the start: if it looks interesting to you it’s right there to use from the get-go. This also counts for abilitiesThe bad:Boost lobbies: Guerrilla games bet everything on the fact that players would make their playlists for them\, and provide these to the community. The best the community has been able to come up with is boost lobbies. Most bad points stem from how badly this concept blew up in Guerrilla’s face. No one uses the system meant to serve as the very core of the game.Generic: everything unique which couldn’t be used on every map for the player created playlists\, had to go. No jetpacks or mech’s (these were in Killzone 3) are fine\, but the problem is that every single match you play will be identical. This is due to the fact that only the Guerrilla games created playlists have any players in them. the modularity also means that beacons and pylons are used as objectives across multiple modes\, these all look the same\, adding to the feeling of monotony.Low player count: on an average weekday in Europe no more than 300 people are playing\, at least 250 of them in the extended warzone playlist. Not a problem so long as you can find a lobby\, were it not for the fact that community created content is the absolute heart of multiplayer here. That heart isn't beating\, that's a problem.Spawn rape: I put in 20 hours for this review\, no match\, not a single one\, did not involve one team spawn raping the other into oblivion. Matches will end 0-5 almost without exception. Players will wait slightly outside the bounds of the other team’s spawn and then kill them as they round corners meant to prevent easy lines of sight. There is a reason why almost every game has abandoned the turrets and barriers type of spawning base. These are hopelessly easy to exploit because the enemy knows exactly where you HAVE to come from\, and will thus lock down every exit easily.The campaign is pathetic. It's ham-fisted attempts at evoking an emotional response via obnoxious audio diaries or the banal first mission are only compounded by nonsensical attempts at environmental puzzles. Enemies will always notice you but somehow can't think of a more effective means of attack than slowly walking towards you whilst discharging their weapon. Your player character is also an imbecile\, he gets himself caught to save some soldiers only to get the ones he was trying to save killed alongside the extra soldiers making the exchange. This for a prisoner vital enough to the Helghast that they'd even agree to a trade in the first place. He could have just killed the main villain easilly and have avoided everything that happened afterwards. The plot expects you to take it very seriously\, hence my harsh criticism.Shadowfall isn't killzone\, if you want that\, go play killzone 3 on the PS3. In that title your character has mass\, and handles as if they are a person with all the heavy gear and armour on that they look to be wearing. The core mode is a superior variant of rush from bad company 2 with cool cutscenes featuring your character and unique weapons that are all equally viable. This on top of the gradually changing level and well balanced classes.I'm afraid that With Killzone Shadowfall\, Guerrilla games shadowfailed. They have delivered a game rife with great ideas but crippled by poor execution and a lack of either direction or its own identity. It certainly isn't a bad game by any means\, just not worth your money amidst it's superior alternatives. If all you care about are graphics however\, buy it\, you will have no regrets.… Expand"

The game is beautiful\, and even more so\, fun. A lot of reviewers will say this game is generic\, but it just isn't true. The combination of all the best features in First Person Shooters combined into a single game does not make a game generic.I've been playing this game on normal\, and it's exactly that as well. Normal mode will get you killed\, but you can always find a way out of a situation by trying again and doing something different. It's an open-ended\, yet linear experience\, and therefore doesn't make you feel as though you are playing a game that the developers laid out for you.Single-Player Campaign: One of the best I've ever played. A lot of shooters have felt really dull as of late (Bioshock Infinite was a dull game with an amazing and redeeming ending. I'm a sucker for good story telling.)\, however this is a HUGE exception. The game's story feels new\, yet familiar\, and it's very exciting to see how the game's story unfolds. The story will have you guess what's going to happen next\, and you'll probably be right\, however\, it's an exciting \""I KNEW IT\"" feeling you get\, rather then it being cliche\, because it really isn't. You can only go so far with a FPS before it becomes a FPS with RPG elements to change things up\, and this game decided to stay as a FPS but incorporate ideas used in other games\, and add them all in one beautifully crafted pizza of a game. Without going into what the story is about\, let me just say that you'll enjoy it thoroughly.Multiplayer: Like I've said\, I didn't really get far in it\, but it is a blast for sure\, even with the bots.Gameplay: The campaign is mostly open-ended. You can go in stealthy most of the time and kill your enemies before they spot you\, or Rambo it up and kill your victims as you stare them down. It features some pretty interesting platformer puzzles\, which actually were pretty fun\, in a scary \""Oh god\, I'm probably going to die\"" sort of way. In single-player campain you also get an \""OWL\""\, which is a flying droid that you control which has 4 amazing features such as an attack mode (which should really be called \""distraction mode\"")\, it can be used as a shield (which sadly only stays in place\, but it's good when you're in a firefight)\, stun mode (which electrocutes enemies like robots\, and disables shields)\, and lastly: ZIPLINE MODE\, which\, doesn't really serve much purpose other then getting you down from high places...If you like FPS's and don't want to buy your annual CoD\, then buy this game.

The graphical powerhouse is the best looking FPS in the console market to date. I'm not going to deny the abundant use of lens flare and particle effects\, but where many are saying they are just there because they can\, I think all of them make sense and are used effectively. The level designs are varied both in a corridor/open sense as well as a visual style sense. These include the beautiful city of Vekta to the oppressive Helgast cities we are used to as a visuals. But new surprises were nicely horrific space stations\, container city slums and the cracked surface of Helgan that was destroyed at the end of KZ3. All this combines to be the most visually impressive and fun environmental games I have experienced recently. I have to say I am a bit biased as far as Sci-Fi anything to me is better than Modern Day. I just get more excited about things that could be instead of things that actually areGameplay is better than ever. I still like the heavy feel of guns in this game\, big guns have Weight! The shooting mechanic is tight and reliable. If ever a mistake was made shooting it was my own and not bad controls. I really liked the change of pacing in this one with more focus on the stealth being a shadow marshal. This is what sets it apart from BF4 and COD for me. The action is intense in this one but it also slows down and allows you tactfully take on a battle. With gadgets and weapons focused on helping you achieve this. Example\, I used an echo to see a mech through walls and waited patiently while it walked up a ramp underneath a large crate. I threw an EMP grenade to freeze it and shot the crate down smashing the mech like a pancake. Purely why I enjoyed KZ:SF more than COD or BF4. Those are great but all action. Many have complained about the \""on rails\"" sections\, I never felt this way. I think these sequences made sense and were very fun. As we transition into the new generation however I do hope they make things more and more open and less and less \""on rails\"" but some of those bits are still very fun to me.Story is great! many say it falls flat but I think it was quite enjoyable. A bit predictable but I think the dichotomy presented in this really highlights the idea of there is rarely a \""good\"" or \""bad\"" side\, only your way of seeing it depending on which side you are on or if you are stuck in the middle. I think it's not the level of story telling say \""Last of Us\"" or \""Bioshock\"" (any of them) have achieved\, but comparatively I think it's story is better than COD or BF4. Don't get me wrong I think those also did a good job\, but for me KZ:SF just did it better.Finally sound design is impeccable. Gunfire\, explosions and the like are all spot on. The sci-fi sounds of hovering drop ships and electrified shield bursting are all great as well. no sound stood out as weird or wrong which is the way it should be. And on top of all that\, the music straight blew me away! The whole game I was constantly saying to myself that this music is amazing. Non conventional in many instances and yet is still worked perfectly. Much better than COD although I thought BF4 had some nice music\, KZ:SF has the best music by far. *SPOILER* the audio files and their presentation was the most unexpected\, yet simple and perfect way for the player to experience them. The speaker in the controller needs to be used more like this because it made me feel like I picked up the audio file and played on my own personal device and was listening to it all the while the game\, its sounds and music kept on playing like I was still in that world. Perfect really perfect. never thought something that sounds so silly would be so effective and engaging.Oh and multiplayer is my favorite. have loved it since KZ2. now with prettier levels\, but balanced\, varied and fun levels at that. Probably about to go play now!overall I think this game is great and anyone who says it's terrible or whatever are clearly not playing the same game I played.

Not only the technical part of the graphics\, but also the artistic direction. Everything is just beautiful\, and I caught myself quite a lot of time just looking at the view.Then\, I really appreciate the fact that Guerrilla didn't want to make the same Killzone as the 3 first before Shadow Fall. The campaign is longer\, and better. Some might complain about the fact that it has lass action and more exploration\, but in my opinion\, it was a very good choice. No more running towards any Hellgast you'll see. Well\, you can still do it\, but you can also be more sneaky\, and it's just great.The OWL is another interesting add to the game\, but I feel like it may be a little bit too effective sometimes.The OST of the game is just amazing. Each side of the Wall (You'll figure out what this is by playing the game) has its own atmosphere\, and it's just eargasmic.The storyline is better than the previous Killzone games\, but still far from perfect: it has a few action movie cliché\, but it's still very nice: the war is more subtle\, no more \""nobrain\"" charges and no more bad guys and good guys. Yes\, the Helgast are a threat\, but the Vektans are far from being \""clean\"" in this war.  It's not as manichean as it was before\, and this is also a very good thing. The campaign is 9-12 hours long\, and it's quite a ride\, for sure.The multiplayer is also very fun\, and you can make your own rules\, on the maps you've chosen\, and trust me\, if you're into MP\, you'll spend dozens of hours playing.In a nutshell\, this game is good. And by good I mean VERY good. It's gorgeous\, fun to play\, much longer than the others FPS launch titles (*cough*CoD BF4*cough*)\, the storyline is well written\, the OST is very good as well\, etc...The first Killzone game is still my favourite\, but Killzone Shadow Fall is the best from the series.Well done Guerrilla.… Expand"

Hand holding is almost non existent and when it implement it guerilla cleverly disguised its pressence /existance with the games flow and tempo.No holy grail of a.i here but the helghast does not tend to kamikazi themselves by running full speed toward your 800 rounds per second. A.I uses cover well and rarely throws grenades at suicidal angles\, tbh guerilla did a fine job in terms of the a.i being programmed good enough that it doesnt break the immersion they designed\, a.i  compliments rather than humilate the gameplay = fun gunplay with very little smh t ala moh warfighter turkey shoot.Guns feel great and are classic kz creations\, not over the top op'd generics but rather somewhat believable futuristic guns\, believing in v ideo games always a plus.campaign is a decent length and the visuals aare top notch nexr gen yummy\, story is meh and kz mercs had a better one imo. There is some destructability but not on the level as say BF4. campaign fun but instantly forget me yes but cant say the same for the MP.Multiplaya is where this game freaking excells !A very unique \, up tempo\, tactical\, oh so fun engagement in varied maps/locations multiplayer that is like no other. It has its own flavor which is so tasty i rebought the game after trading in for thief\, the irony thief robbed my for 63 dollars and credit but thats neither here or there back on topic.guerilla unlocks all the guns from press start which levels playing field imho but you do upgrade turrets and unlock weapon scopes and mounts but it is needed for the player to feel progression which is better than feeling op'd due to level 76 prestige having a minigun while you enter late in the game per se wielding a but naked ak 47. Bottom line the mp designed with the gamer in mind on every level and i rate the mp as being top notch which can go toe to toe with any fps mp on the market as well as having one of the best hit boxes.Some are used to chocolate and vanilla and wont venture towards new or different flavors\, CoD or BF4 are familiar territories\, a comfort zone if you will and thats perfectly respectable  / fine especially when its your dime but i will say this =   change isnt always a bad thing and on that note KZSF campaign IS ACCEPTABLE AND THE MP IS REFRESHING & DERSERVING of good merit as well as a try but as they say different strokes for different folks well lets just say KZSF MP stroked my cords .P freakin S Guerilla I DEMAND A HELGHAST CAMPAIGN!Btw bgm fantastic as always and visually the 2nd best looking game this gen  imo close secong to mgsv ground zeroes.My psn is pixelprov1  \, hope you were able to take  something positive / helpful from thisTc… Expand"

Grenades take 10 seconds to throw\, and you will be killed by enemy fire before you can throw one. Enemies have X-Ray binocular vision and have no problem shooting a moving target and making cover is almost worthless. The levels themselves are made non-sensical by arbitrary use of fences or piles of rubble. At least 25% of the game is spent looking for the waypoint. One frustrating set of levels uses the same non-sensical logic puzzle. You need to disable sentry devices in the same way. Moving forward\, however\, has nothing to do with disabling the sentries devices themselves. The same is true of missions where you have to defend a position while you wait for a computer to activate or an aircraft to land. The event only occurs when all enemies are elimited. Other portions of the game are nearly broken\, with one boss fight going far too long when the invisible boss went missing for several minutes.Shadowfail may have decent multiplayer\, but I will never know. The on-line lobbies are all Ghost towns in 2016. Considering the mediocre response to this game\, that's not surprising. I am assuming Shadowfail is the end of the Killzone series.

Do NOT determine your purchase on one mans opinion\, preferals and reviews. This review contains somewhat harsh feedback but i enjoy this game to an extend and would not regret my 60 euro purchase if i didn't get it as a birthday present.Killzone Shadow fall is a good game\, but as a big Killzone fan it pains me to admit this game is overall the least impressive game in the franchise. The talented FPS developer Guerrilla finally went to the right direction with the story but failed to deliver what it was supposed to become and brought us an underdeveloped story with even less likeable characters than in the previous games with sometimes silly voice acting. Whats worse is the flawed game design\, a.i\, confusing empty open levels\, broken stealth elements during the campaign.The Multiplayer design is great and you can see developers like Eric Boltjes did their best to listen to fan feedback ad much as possible by making it more teambased than killzone 3. Sadly\, the overall dramaticly changed art design and set pieces\, which always made the franchise distinct from the typical generic shooters just made it lose its identity and soul.Contrary to previous killzones\, Shadow fall has a more arcady feel\, uninspiring looking weapons\, gun sounds and sounds of explosions that sound more like arcade machines\, rather than feeling like you're on an actual futuristic warfield. Overall\, this is a decent\, yet the in my opinion best MP shooter that launched up until Titanfall but this is a terrible changd for Killzone fans. For me\, Killzone Shadow Fall is an ok\, pretty fun Multiplayer shooter with the name Killzone attached to it and the overall change of pace\, set pieces and art direction made it lose its Soul.I really want to see another Killzone game but an actual sequel to Killzone 2 and 3. More colours are fine but please Guerrilla keep the same set pieces and pacing and overall art design and weight the fanbase expected from a Killzone game instead of focussing on a on existent fanbase.ProsBeautiful visualsVery Solid\, fun\, team oriented multiplayer!ConsVery Disappointing and frustrating second half of the campaignUnderdeveloped Story and CharactersUninspiring weaponsNo epic gun sounds and sounds from explosionsLacking the epic set pieces and living environment that was present in the Multiplayer in Killzone 3.

While this one has bettered some of the things i thought the original had faulted with\, it still does a poor job of creating a truly \""next gen\"" experience.There were a lot of frustrating moments in the game that served little more then a test of patience. Also for an odd design choice the starting rifle you start with cannot be dropped. If you play on any of the higher difficulties and use the weapon a lot you will be finding yourself stuck with one empty weapon and struggling to find another weapon to use for the next wave of enemies.Killzone has the illusion of a good weapon variety\, but you'll mostly only come across Heligan weapons and most of them just feel the same. I would go from rifle to rifle\, and without maybe the difference in attachments (grenade launcher\, scope\, ect) the guns just felt the same.The story it self is engaging enough\, but feel lack luster compared to other modern shooters. It kept me going but of course the end left me in a \""wtf just happened\"" moment\"" and a sequelbait ending. The opening of the game does a well enough job to set up the game so that you don't have to play the previous 3 games to understand what is going on\, but the reason that the Heligan are on the IAS home world is just baffling.Overall it is slightly above average as far as other modern shooters that are available.

Cloaks\, teleportation\, turrets\, shields\, stun drones\, more. But some of them are a bit over the top. The air support drone for example is pretty obnoxious. It flies around and forces you to hide behind a wall until it goes away or else you get killed. Spider grenades can be very obnoxious\, too.The worst part about multiplayer is that some players lag so badly they're basically invincible. They'll warp around and stutter and you can shoot them\, and they will die\, but sometimes only a minute later after they've killed you and the rest of your buddies. I'm serious\, you can shoot them\, run away\, hide in a corner and half a minute later it will say you shot them to death. Thankfully\, this problem is not nearly as bad as it was when the game first launched. Another problem that seems to be caused by lag is that in laggy games\, ladders either become unusable\, or you get stuck on them! Very annoying.Last month-ish the developers released a map pack with four or five-ish new maps for free. That was a nice gesture in this era of paid DLC.

That makes this latest entry so much more disappointing. While not entirely bad there's enough going wrong here to make it worth passing up.For starters there's the campaign\, which just feels like a way to show off the graphical capabilities of the PS4 rather than providing a fun experience. Make no mistake\, this is a gorgeous game. Unfortunately visual splendor can only carry an experience so far. With boring storytelling\, frustrating shootouts\, pathetic weapons\, and occasionally unresponsive controls the single-player experience falls short. The biggest issue with the campaign is just that it doesn't feel like Killzone. What we get instead is just a really bad Call of Duty.The multiplayer on the other hand is a blast. It's fun\, chaotic\, and most definitely Killzone. However it too isn't without it's flaws. For one the experience in dying rather quickly. You can still almost always find full matches of team deathmatch\, but the other modes it just comes down to when you look. There are times when the game will be buzzing with activity\, and times when you'll be wondering where everyone is. Bot matches are available\, but they just aren't the same.It's a shame the more objective based modes are the ones that are usually empty. Those are the ones that keep people moving. Unfortunately most TDM matches end up with a lot of camping. They usually turn out with one team trapping the other in their spawn base. Matches are still action packed and both sides can still get kills regardless if they're the trapper or the trapped\, but it can really suck getting holed up like that.Shadow Fall's multiplayer portion can still be a heck of a lot of fun\, but the camping and an ever diminishing player base are turn offs. With the single-player offering falling flat on it's face and the co-operative mode only being available as paid DLC it's hard to really recommend it. It's a big disappointment considering it's part of the usually excellent Killzone series. It can still provide some competitive thrills\, but no one would blame you for passing this game in favor of games that are more satisfying overall.I give it a 6.2/10… Expand"

There are rarely ever any flanking orders\, but sometimes you will hear them shouting back and forth commands to each other that sadly do not actually happen. The story-line is decent but not overly amazing. It will keep you engaged if you are expecting the equivalent of a blockbuster movie\, but don't expect anything worth mentioning years from now.The major flaws of the game are mainly that it's too generic. There is nothing very revolutionary about the game whatsoever other than its visual quality. Many praise this game for being very difficult but all I see is waves upon waves of enemies which will eventually lead to a death or too until you get the hang of the game. Overall this \""adjustment\"" to difficulty is just poor work on the developers part\, but it is one way to get more for less so to speak.Multiplayer is fun but again there isn't much to keep you hooked past maybe a weeks worth of playing unless you only buy a new game once every few months. My final verdict puts this game at something a KillZone fan should buy but not at the sixty dollar price tag. Wait till it goes on sale then grab it. Or rent it from Redbox or something.… Expand"

I'm not sure weather that's because I've been playing campaigns like Ghosts or BF4 recently\, where the story is just an afterthought\, this was defiantly a well thought out experience.  It spans a little over 10 hours and has you going from places i never expected it to\, you'll be trudging around a Infected spaceship thats covered in bodies and biohazard signs one second\, fighting through a terrorist attack\, sneaking out of a enemy encampment\, then skydiving through a destroyed city the next\, it was a blast to play from start to finish.  I had a few minor parts where i couldn't progress well but i got over them easily when i figured out how to get away from the enemies.  The boss fights they had were amazing and really fun\, and gameplay is different enough from the standard affair.  I'm not saying this game was amazing and totally reinvents the wheel\, but it defiantly will hold up for years.  Using the zipline to actually get around areas and hacking doors and such is fun\, you have different ways to approach areas\, whether its stealthily taking guards down one by one\, or guns blazing\, its up to you.  This level of freedom is welcoming even if its not to the degree of a game like FarCry 3. The shooting all feels good and well and works as it should (minor complaints that the sensitivity didn't go as high as id wanted it to and yes it was turned all the way up\, i like high sensitivity.) and the guns felt solid and fun to use.  Each guns secondary was useful in different ways when they would show up. All and all its a game worth playing if you own a ps4\, i've seen people saying the campaign dragged on\, but honestly in this day and age\, were used to 4-5 hours for a shooter. This is a solid experience of about 10 hours\, which i feel is a good thing.  I'm coming away from this game having only played the campaign and i feel good about it. (also MY GOD THAT ENDING\, it wasn't a set up for a new game\, but it was a good yet shocking ending.)TL;DRThis game manages to surprise and have a interesting story that i actually found to be shocking at parts\, the gameplay is not completely new but changes enough to make me feel satisfied\, the campaign is long which is good because most games are short overall its a fun game and worth it even if you just play the story.… Expand"

The plot itself is decent\, however poorly executed. If you asked me to tell you what happened\, I simply wouldn't be able to tell you because the storytelling is so unbelievably poor that it completely fails to convey what's going on  at the end of the day it feels like a chain of disjointed missions with some reoccurring characters. The gameplay itself is decent\, the characters aren't as snappy or responsive as they could be\, but no worse than any other Killzone title in that respect either. Tools like the Owl\, as well as many of the multiplayer perks help keep things interesting\, but they fail to use any of these gadgets in a particularly creative way. The singleplayer campaign itself is around 10 hours long on hard at a guess\, which is a fair bit longer than your average FPS these days\, and the graphics are incredible and the level design is generally very good. Unfortunately\, there ain't much re-playability here as there's no co-op\, no higher difficulty etc  if your first playthrough was on hard\, bar trophy grinding\, there really isn't any reason to play through again. The multiplayer is also decent\, there's plenty of interesting perks and abilities\, but a great number of the weapons are dull and samey\, and the multiplayer gameplay despite it's creative intentions just end up being frag matches at certain map choke points. There are bots you can play against\, but they're the equivalent of a practice mode in that you can't do any challenges or unlock anything while fighting against them\, so they're not really useful to the average antisocial gamer. The last of a third mode outside of singleplayer and multiplayer limits the value of this game as well. While many games will have a third\, like horde mode\, or zombies\, or something like that\, all this has is SP and MP. Nothing else.

First the graphics\, Killzone Shadow Fall looks incredible\, easily the most the beautiful game I've played\, from sprawling\, bright vistas to dingy\, dark and narrow corridors this game never fails to amaze. The story is very deep with plenty of lore but fails to fully engage due to weak and somewhat predictable plot points and an uninspired protagonist in Lucas Kellan. The gameplay is stronger than most other linear FPS games such as the COD franchise due to some unique new features such as the owl which is a cool little flying robot which you can use in either in offensive or defensive ways during combat. Deciding what you would like the Owl to do is done using the dualshock 4's touchpad. You also have the ability to scan an area before entering to locate the position of enemies which allows you to set up how you want to enter a situation wether it be stealthily or guns blazing both are enjoyable and satisfying. The voice acting is passable but doesn't impress and unfortunately the lip syncing is poor which distracts from the game's beauty at times. Towards the end of the game the gameplay starts to feel like a grind and the story was the only thing that kept me going.The multiplayer is a very enjoyable experience with tight and intense gameplay and uses a game mode that is unique to the Killzone series called warzones which combines multiple game modes into one match and also allows you to create your own games which lets you tailor the game modes to what you feel like playing at the time.Overall Killzone Shadow Fall is a good game but not great. At times it feels like a tech demo\, showing off what the PS4 can do and it succeeds at this. Killzone Shadow Fall's single player campaign is enjoyable enough but the multiplayer presents the lasting value. Killzone Shadow Fall shows off the potential of the PS4 and is a fine way to kick off the next generation of gaming.… Expand"

Such a lost opportunity to make that epic game. With a touch of good narrative this game would be miles better deserving a better score. Not story\, not setting\, but scripts and acting (which allows the characters to grow\, even with simple lines).(3) A minor point: there were some old infinite spawn enemies sessions.

But where the game plummets is in the campaign mode\, mainly in horrible level design.  The game immerses you with its visuals but giving you a waypoint or a good inclination on where to go somehow slips its mind.  For the most part\, the levels are rather open with multiple paths to take and explore\, which normally would be a good thing but Shadow Fall never truly gives you a good sense of where you're going and if you don't go the scripted way you'll fall into a group of enemies and enter a lack luster shooting set piece.  The huge maps almost ruin the gun fights\, you never seem to be in the right space to run behind cover to have an epic shootout.  The game briefly does however provide a waypoint but it goes away and you have to press a button to retrieve it again which breaks up the action and tension the game tries to build by constantly having to pause the game for something that should be a given.

Just look at \""The Last of Us\"" or \""COD Ghosts\"".Getting a PS4 to play this piece of garbage was clearly a mistake.

It fully exploits the power of the new PS4 system and it doesnt try to hide it. There are so many cutscenes where people get right up in your face and you can see every detail in full hd at 60FPS. The city is beautiful with all of its ships and shiny buildings. The AI are smart and will kill you if you treat this like a traditional first person shooter. the combat is great. the runs all look amazing although some look and feel to similar for my taste\, There is also not much variety in the guns. Your character has a drone with some abilities that you will only ever need to use once. There is only one real boss fight and it is just decent. Its tough at first but I was still able to beat it in one try.The campaign isnt perfect. like i said they take what chances they get into showing off the graphics and the power of the console. but in doing so they took focus off some of the missions. there is one mission where you and a few other soldiers are fighting off waves of enemies untill someone can get a ship prepared for your escape. well You really dont have to do much defending\, there are weapons layed out that are pretty over powered and the enemies dont exactly do any hardcore rushing\, sure there are some that do it but they are easy to pick off. There's actually an area that you can sit where the enemies will sit around you\, shoot at you\, but they wont hit you or advance at you. that level wasn't to thrilling. The AI is smart usually but in that mission they decided to derp out.I was almost disappointed with the ending\, until one other thing happened. No spoilers but you will be pleasantly surprised with the final partNow for multiplayer. I have one way of summing it up. It felt like crisis. That's about it. if you like crisis you like this game. I was kinda hoping for something that felt completely different. you dont earn any of the guns\, you just earn gear for them. then your gear slots for drones and deployable turrets and other stuff has everything unlocked as well. but you can level up the gear. The class with the LMG's are over powered imo because you get a giant attack drone that will demolish an unsuspecting team\, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN IT! I literally wait for the enemy team to come out of there spawn and have my drone placed at their spawn. they get destroyed every time.Overall I really enjoyed the game\, but future games will need some improvement. the graphics are great\, but lets get some gameplay that knocks the competition out.… Expand"

I haven't spent much time with the campaign (played a level or two)\, but that was never what excited me about the game. If you're looking into it for its single player component you may be disappointed\, but it is my favorite online shooter for PS4 so far. The levels are varied\, and each one is gorgeous. Of the fps titles available at launch this was the only one designed exclusively for next-gen systems and it shows. The lighting and textures make the game a treat to look at. In terms of gameplay it feels like a fairly typical shooter\, but done very well. There is nothing that makes Shadow Fall very unique\, but what it does include feels very good. There are several abilities tied to each of the three classes you can play as. Several of these can get annoying at times\, especially if you face a whole team of people using them. Each team also has a fixed base on the map where they will spawn unless a teammate has set down a spawn beacon that you can use. The predictability of the spawns means that there is a chance for the opposing team to set up around your base\, and once that happens there isn't much you can do. There are automated turrets at each base to prevent them from getting too close\, but these only do so much. It's fairly easy to set up outside of their range. Once that's done\, the game becomes as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.  This is a bigger issue in the team deathmatch modes where there isn't as much of an incentive to move about the map\, but even in the objective based modes there's a chance once team gets the other pinned in their base.I would say 7/10 of my matches are free of ability spam and spawn camping (not the greatest percentage\, i know)\, and when its running well Shadow Fall is a lot of fun to play. There is no aim assist which means the kills are generally slower\, and it tends to reward better players. The characters move more smoothly than in passed Killzone titles\, and the game is actually pretty fast paced. The game won't be everyones cup of tea\, but I really enjoy it despite not having been the biggest fan of past Killzone games. It might be the game I've spent the most time with since PS4's launch.… Expand"

For those of you who have never played a Killzone title\, this game is a must buy if you get the PS4 because this game offers an interesting mix of common modern shooters and sci fi shooters.CampaignKillzone: Shadow Fall takes place 30 years after the events of KZ 3 and Vekta city is divided. The story reminds the player immediately of a cold war esque story between good and evil however if you watch the trailers\, you will delve deeper into a twisted story of corruption and lies. As a noob of the Killzone series I immedeatly played hard mode and noticed no difficulty in killing my foes however this may be just for the few starting levels. I hope that is ineed the case.Campaign Rating: 8/10MultiplayerI am not sure if I am somehow very good at Killzone or if everyone is just really bad at the multiplayer but either way I got a lot of fun out of the multiplayer as I really loved the gameplay in the trailers. I highly recommend newbies to the franchise to try out fighting bots or going to one of the low level Warzones. The elephant in the room (As said by TotalBiscuit almost in every video) that I think the critics are getting attacked by fans of the Playstation is that the game offers no innovation in anyway when it comes to multiplayer. It's true. Critics are right that the game has no innovation with game modes I mean for crying out loud\, is search and destroy in every game now including Battlefield 4?

While the multiplayer is not inherently bad\, it doesn't live up to the standard that has been set by CoD and Battlefield. Speaking as a Battlefield player\, I personally felt like there was just too much of the same thing going on with pretty much everything in the game. Most of the weapons felt the same and the maps didn't feel very compelling to continue playing. The single-player takes the cake here as it's challenging and long\, about 10 hours to complete. While the story isn't great\, it's the best story I've seen in a single-player shooter in a long time. I really wanted this game to be the showcase game for the system. Instead it lived up to the Killzone name by presenting us a solid shooter that just doesn't quite live up to the hype that surrounded it. And with both Battlefield 4 and CoD being on the PS4\, it's very hard to recommend this game over one of the two others\, especially to a fan of either game.… Expand"

Really it's probably more of an 8.5\, but I gave it a 9 to round up.Single Player: The gameplay is a little disjointed\, but when the action is happening its a blast. Some of the earlier levels just start out slow. The style of play is drastically different than games like COD or even the old KZ games so when you approach this game do so with an open mind. I think a lot of reviewer did not find what they expected and so the game got lower scores. This game is not an all out war\, but instead you are usually fighting through small bands of enemies and then you may have some downtime before you encounter the next group. The thing is\, the enemy waves are hard and you have to use some strategy to really be successful. One thing that holds it back though is the fact that you can use the OWL to revive. Yes there is a limit on how many times you can do this\, but because of the adrenaline rush that you get that slows down the battle\, you can usually use the adrenaline\, pass the part you had trouble with\, and move on to find more adrenaline packs. The difficulty is high though so it doesn't take away too much\, but I feel it is a little too forgiving.The single player has great quality and varied environments and gameplay. Probably the best way to describe it is like a really good independent movie. Parts really shine\, and outshine the Hollywood films by a great measure\, but some things should have been cut and some things should have been approached a little differently. Ultimately at the heart there is a great game\, but it takes a little patience at parts.Multiplayer is great\, I'm not going to write more about it but just to say its really fun\, but probably will not keep you interested as long as a game like BF4.… Expand"

Maps are very well made and varied although a little more CQC than previous Killzone titles.  Since launch their have been many welcome changes.  Overpowered weapons and abilities were nerfed & underpowered weapons and abilities were buffed.  Challenge requirements were adjusted.  Ranking system tied to challenges was introduced.  New maps were added for FREE.  Automata skins\, player skins\, player cards\, cross hair reticules\, voice packs\, end of game moves were all added for more customization.  Clan support was finally added with more support to come.  If you are reading this and tried the game at launch please give it another shot as you may be surprised.  The best experience will always come from Extended Warzone or Classic as opposed to Team Deathmatch but sadly that is what the majority of newcomers gravitate towards due to familuarity with COD.  Trust me you are missing out.  Get a mic and talk to the veterans and most will help you out with all the little nuances of the game.  As far Single Player it got a bum rap from reviewers as well.  It is quite different from KZ2 and KZ3 style but there is still sections of intense battle.  There are sections where you have great freedom in the way you go about finishing the level ( routes\, order\, stealth or guns blazing).  You can pick up various different weapons to change up gameplay.  The OWL can allow you to play the game several diffetent styles depending on how you use it.

Unfortunately there are some minor annoyances that keep the game from being great.The storyline is pretty good and the first thing you'll probably notice are the gorgeous graphics. Gameplay is great too never experiencing any problems. The touchpad is only used as another D-pad to control OWl\, your robot companion\, in the game. While it wouldn't be that bad that the touchpad is only used as another D-pad\, the problem is that OWL is pretty much useless. You can get him to do only four things but throughout the game you'll forget to use OWL unless you need him to hack a console.You can't do anything while your sending it out\, not even be running\, which adds another reason why you wouldn't want to use OWL in this fast paced action game but then it also gets bad that the devs force you to use OWL when up against super shielded enemies. You can either waste a couple of clips taking out a shield of one of those heavily shielded enemies or use OWL to take out their shield. While it may sound that OWL may actually be useful\, the attack OWL uses only works on a small area. So while your waiting for OWL to take out the shield of 1 of those heavily shielded enemies\, you still have to worry about the other 4 or 5 that are trying to take you down.The multiplayer in the game plays really well. Not once did I have any connection issues. The game modes are fun too and I was more into the first game mode which is the basic one. Your in a team and go rounds playing random game matches like team deathmatch\, then it whoever wins next round might be capture and hold and so on. You got different loadouts so you can experiment and see which one you like. Unlike Battlefield 4 and CoD though you won't find much when it comes to unlockables. If you chose to play the regular assault\, like I did\, you'll find that all the primary weapons are unlocked. You can unlock only 3 shotguns if you want and unlock all the abilities right away. About the only depth in unlockables is trying to level up your abilities\, those that can level up at least\, but when it came to assault I found I really only wanted to level up the little droid that has your back since the level up only makes it so your abilities last longer and you only have a handful of abilities. Not much to do in the customization option but the multiplayer gameplay was fun in itself that it might make you want to just jump and start playing.Overall I think the game is pretty good for a launch title to show off the PS4 capabilities and what really pops out are those graphics. I just can't describe how much better looking this game is compared to a PS3 game. I would definitely recommend this as a launch title buy if you want a fun game that also makes good use of the PS4 capabilities.… Expand"

Phrases like \""cookie-cutter FPS\"" are commonplace\, and some say the breathtaking graphics only offset the \""tedium\"" of gameplay. I couldn't disagree more. It may be predictable\, but only in an exemplary fashion. Much like a Steinway & Sons piano\, you know what to expect and there are no surprises  but it still plays beautifully. This isn't a boring FPS\, it is everything an FPS should be.The campaign on hard is pretty hard. It makes for a fun challenge and demands strategic efforts\, somewhat unlike CoD and Halo. Killzone's campaign feels\, to me\, a little bit like the best bits of Ghost Recon and CoD combined\, with a unique Killzone essence thrown in to the mix. The story\, however\, is bad. It's a childish commentary on foreign policy which\, I can't imagine\, would be taken seriously by anyone with a real interest in such issues. A political discussion isn't what an FPS is for\, obviously\, so perhaps we shouldn't be too critical of it. I just can't help thinking that they should have stuck to a less politically orientated story.The multiplayer is excellent: queues are short\, game modes are interesting\, maps are fantastic and the roles are more balanced than in the previous Killzone. The scout's invisibility now works in a way that is useful but not overpowered/used by every single player on the map. Every role (scout\, assault and support) is useful and remains viable even when played as they are intended to be played.

When i first saw the game at E3 i was amazed by the graphics and when i play the game i am still amazed. This is by far the prettiest launch title across both consoles and it goes nicely with the fun and more unique multiplayer. The multiplayer is not focused on prestige like other First Person shooters are all about. This multiplayer is more about just enjoying playing it along with unlocking cool player cards. At first i have to say it can be a bit confusing due to the menus not being easy to navigate but once you start using it you will find yourself being able to maneuver it quite easily. The gamemode Warzone is very fun to play and exciting. The game is also not as focused on kills like other FPS games are but more focused on a collective score from missions\, kills\, and challenges. The campaign is also fun and offers a good challenge. The campaign is fun and a great bonus to the solid multiplayer. For the average Call of Duty player you may find yourself not liking it just because its not what your used to but if you give it a chance and or you feel Call of Duty is getting old\, this is a great title to pick up! I would give this game a solid 9.5 but because there is no option and there are negative reviews for no good reason i will give this a 10. If the menus were a little more easy to navigate however i would probably have given this a 10 anyways.… Expand"

Audio is also very nice and a noticeable improvement over PS3 KZ titles.Singleplayer is hit and miss and if I were to judge based on single player alone\, I would give it a 7.5-8/10.  You could sense the vision Guerrilla wanted to take it\, but they just seemed to lack the time to really refine the story and level design.  It is still a very decent single player campaign though\, and it clocks in a decent length of ~10-11hrs.With that said\, it's the multiplayer where this game really shines.  Silky smooth 60fps (for the most part) amazing visuals\, completely customizable games and solid gameplay and controls.Overall\, I'd say that this is a pretty solid launch title.  It showcases the PS4's power nicely and it is a solid game overall.… Expand"

95024,8,"[Condensed]While there have been excellent titles from the getgo within this console series\, and even within the handheld accompaniments of recent times\, Killzone: Shadow Fall is second only to Killzone 3 in my mind\, and rises above Killzone 2 and the original Killzone in so many ways. It beats each game in terms of visuals and competent gameplay\, as well as evolving the still fresh multiplayer experience past anything I could've hoped for. This game is definitely the highlight of my Play Station 4 coverage and playing\, and I wouldn't have missed it for anything else this year. It may not be receiving the best score of all from me\, but I have enjoyed it a lot and the story alone provides so much of a replay value and time commitment as well. Shadow Fall makes me wish that the next game in the series would come sooner\, and it is that excitement and anxiety that makes me love it all the more.Concept: A great start to the next generation of shooters and games in general.Graphics: Some of the best visuals and animations that I have seen in a long while\, and something to set the standard for next generation games as well.Sound: The voice acting isn't always the strongest\, but the musical scores hit all the right vibes for a futuristic city perfectly.Playability: The controls are well balanced and laid out\, and the extraneous commands for the OWL and allies also fit in the mix without confusing players at all. In a series noted for its excellent controls\, these are some of the best.Entertainment: From the story to the gameplay\, this is an exciting and entertaining adventure.Replay Value: High.Overall Score: 8.5… Expand"

Multiplayer\, while fun at times\, doesn't innovate or make the series remain fresh and ends up feeling like a generic shooter. This game is said to run at 60 frames per second online\, which is not entirely true. Killzone Shadow Fall struggles to even maintain at least 50 frames per second and dropping as low as 30\, that is unacceptable.
